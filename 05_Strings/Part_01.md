#🐍 Strings in Python

---

# 📖 What is a String?

A **String** is a collection of characters enclosed inside **single quotes (' ')**, **double quotes (" ")**, or **triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """)**.

A string is used to store **text data** such as names, addresses, passwords, emails, messages, and many more.

---

# 🌍 Real-World Example

Imagine you are filling a college admission form.

You enter:

- Student Name
- College Name
- Department
- Email Address

All these are text values.

Python stores all these text values as **Strings**.

Example:

```python
name = "Gokul"
college = "SNS College of Technology"
department = "AIML"
email = "gokul@gmail.com"
```

---

# ❓ Why Do We Need Strings?

Strings are used whenever we need to store text.

Some real-world examples are:

- Student Name
- Mobile Number
- Email Address
- Password
- Address
- Product Name
- Book Name
- Website URL

Without strings, Python cannot store text information.

# 📝 Syntax

## Using Single Quotes

```python
name = 'Gokul'
```

## Using Double Quotes

```python
name = "Gokul"
```

## Using Triple Quotes

```python
message = """Welcome
to
Python"""
```

---

# 💻 Example 1

```python
name = "Gokul"

print(name)
```

### Output

```
Gokul
```

---

# 💻 Example 2

```python
college = "SNS College of Technology"

print(college)
```

### Output

```
SNS College of Technology
```

---

# 💻 Example 3

```python
message = """Hello
Welcome
to Python"""

print(message)
```

### Output

```
Hello
Welcome
to Python
```

---

# 📌 String Indexing

Every character in a string has a position called an **index**.

Python starts counting from **0**.

Example

```python
name = "Python"
```

| Character | P | y | t | h | o | n |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

---

# 💻 Accessing Characters

```python
name = "Python"

print(name[0])
```

### Output

```
P
```

---

```python
print(name[1])
```

### Output

```
y
```

---

```python
print(name[5])
```

### Output

```
n
```

---

# 📌 Negative Indexing

Python also supports negative indexing.

It starts counting from the last character.

Example

```python
name = "Python"
```

| Character | P | y | t | h | o | n |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Index | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |

---

### Example

```python
name = "Python"

print(name[-1])
```

### Output

```
n
```

---

```python
print(name[-2])
```

### Output

```
o
```

---

# ✂️ String Slicing

Slicing is used to get a part of a string.

## Syntax

```python
string[start:end]
```

The **start index is included**.

The **end index is not included**.

---

### Example

```python
name = "Python"

print(name[0:3])
```

### Output

```
Pyt
```

---

```python
print(name[2:6])
```

### Output

```
thon
```

---

```python
print(name[:4])
```

### Output

```
Pyth
```

---

```python
print(name[3:])
```

### Output

```
hon
```

---

```python
print(name[:])
```

### Output

```
Python
```

---

# 🔁 Looping Through a String

A string can be read one character at a time using a **for loop**.

### Example

```python
name = "Python"

for letter in name:
    print(letter)
```

### Output

```
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

---

# 📏 Length of a String

The `len()` function returns the total number of characters in a string.

### Example

```python
name = "Python"

print(len(name))
```

### Output

```
6
```

---

# 🌍 Real-World Applications

Strings are used in almost every software application.

Examples:

- Login Systems
- Email Applications
- Banking Applications
- Social Media Platforms
- E-commerce Websites
- Hospital Management Systems
- College Management Systems
- Chat Applications
- Search Engines
